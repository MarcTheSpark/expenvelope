r"""
Module containing the central :class:`Envelope` class, which represents a piece-wise exponential function.
:class:`Envelope`\ s support arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They
also support horizontal scaling and shifting.

Note also that this is defining a function whose domain is a portion of the real number line, but whose range can
actually be nearly anything, including, e.g., numpy arrays. All of the functionality, even integration, works for
mappings onto other kinds of ranges.

    Class representing a piece-wise exponential function. This class was designed with musical applications in mind,
