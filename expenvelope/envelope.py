r"""
Module containing the central :class:`Envelope` class, which represents a piece-wise exponential function.
:class:`Envelope`\ s support arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They
also support horizontal scaling and shifting.

Note also that this is defining a function whose domain is a portion of the real number line, but whose range can
actually be nearly anything, including, e.g., numpy arrays. All of the functionality, even integration, works for
mappings onto other kinds of ranges.

    r"""
    Class representing a piece-wise exponential function. This class was designed with musical applications in mind,
    with the intention being to represent a continuously changing musical parameter over time. For instance, an
    Envelope might be used to represent the pitch curve of a glissando, or the volume curve of a forte-piano.

    :param levels: the levels of the curve. These can be anything that acts like a number. For instance, one could
        even use numpy arrays as levels.
    :param durations: the durations of the curve segments. (Should have length one less than levels.)
    :param curve_shapes: the curve shape values (optional, should have length one less than levels). Generally these
        will be floats, with the default of 0 representing linear change, > 0 representing late change, and < 0
        representing early change. It is also possible to use the string "exp" to produce constant proportional
        change per unit time, so long as the segment does not touch zero. Finally, strings containing "exp", such
        as "exp ** 2 / 5" will be evaluated with the curve shape required for exponential change being plugged
        in for the variable "exp".
    :param offset: starts curve from somewhere other than zero
